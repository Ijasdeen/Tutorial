# Pizza hut
I've uploaded a completed website using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Jquery, PHP, mySql as well as some animation libraries. It contains not only the pizza but also other meals. It will also enable you to place the order. The next version of this website will include better designing and fast performace by using Ajax. 

Note : Before opening the project. Pelase ensure that your computer is connected to the internet. Because I have put only CDN. If you don't want it to be online project, I've downloaded and kept all required files in the same folder so that you can use easily.  

# What is next?
My purpose is to create those complext websites using known technologies for the people who are in need.
