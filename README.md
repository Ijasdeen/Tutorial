# Pizza hut
I've uploaded a completed website using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Jquery, PHP, mySql as well as some animation libraries. It contains not only the pizza but also other meals. It will also enable you to place the order. The next version of this website will include better designing and fast performace. 

# What is next?

I've decided to develop complex websites for getting people understood how they work. This time, I added documentation for only difficult codes.But I will add full documentation for every single line of codes in future.
